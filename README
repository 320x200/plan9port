This is a fork of plan9port (see README.md for original blurb) that is usually more or less in sync with upstream and has several additions, mostly for acme:

* added bdf2subf utility to p9p
* added a variant of terminus 4.47
* Dump writes to -l path, if specified, else to ~/acme.dump (JillTyrell)
* replaced macOS specific copy/cut/paste/undo/redo shorcut with more portable control keycode (you know... Ctrl-C, Ctrl-X, etc)
* added Ctrl-S to save (Put) currently selected buffer
* up and down arrows do not jump through the buffer anymore but moves the cursors from one line to another
* Toggable tab expansion support via Tabexpand command (Petter Rodhelind)
* themeable acme colors via cmd/acme/config.h
* compose key behaviour under x11 is fixed

Changes that ended up upstream:

* fixed installation to work with FreeBSD 12
* allow hinting and disable autohint only (Xiao-Yong Jin)
