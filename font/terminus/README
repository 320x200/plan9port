Here is a Terminus variant created with the bdf2subf software bundled
in this very p9p distro.

The source is Terminus 4.47, check README.orig and CHANGES.orig for more
information. I only packaged the variant and size I use personally, feel free
to make your own!

For instance, get the latest Terminus source tarball, and using the 
BDF file you want to use as source, you can:

bdf2subf -f ter-u14n.bdf > ~/tmp/ter-u14b.font
bdf2subf ter-u14n.bdf

Copy all the resulting files somewhere and point to the font file from
your fav Plan 9 application.
